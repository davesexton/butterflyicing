       Joanne oringinally for a square cake. However, we got talking and I told her that
       every time my daughter came home she craves Pie and Mash. Joanne said why not do
       a ‘’pie & mash cake’’ I loved the idea! Joanne did it and it was absolutely fantastic,
       it looked so much like the real thing! My daughter thought it was brilliant, she
       took pictures of it to take back to Switzerland. It was really amazing"</b><br />
