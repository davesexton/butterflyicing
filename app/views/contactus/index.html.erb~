<h2>Ordering is simple…</h2>
<p>Take a look at the website to see if any of the designs are what you are looking
   for. If not, and you have a design in mind contact Joanne and from there she can
   look at putting your idea together.</p>
<p>If you are unsure of what to order, speak to Joanne and together you can look at
   what cake best suits your needs.</p>
<p>Each cake can be made differently depending on your specifications.</p>
<p>Ordering a cake is usually done two weeks in advance, but can be made as soon as
   you know what you want, so doesn’t matter how far off this is.</p>
<p>For Wedding cakes, we ideally need 3 months notice' however we can try our best
   to accommodate late orders, so please speak with Joanne for further assistance.</p>
